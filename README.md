##Features

 * Minimalist Design

User interface is intentionally kept simple for quick access to the core features and allow for fast view of useful information. Users can easily check remaining time with the circular progress bar. 


 * Customizable Timer Function
 

Interval training times can be customized for the user at any specified length of time. As an interval training dedicated timer, users can easily set workout rounds and work-rest reps. 


 * Progress Chart

User data would be used to log progress weekly in an effective at-a-glance view that is easy to digest.  This feature helps to build momentum for users who demand results from their workouts. After workout session is done, the app automatically saves the workout log into database and makes the chart data set. 


 * Social Media Integration

Progress can be shared on Facebook to highlight the activity of the user, a great way for friends to interact and be engaged with an healthy and active lifestyle. The app takes a snapshot of the chart and posts it on Facebook.

##Things I'm pround of

 * Used multiple libraries like MPChart, Realm.io, and Facebook sdk. 
 * App actually takes a snapshot of the chart and share it on Facebook. Not the whole screen! 
 * Minimal and clean design
 * Precise timer. Experimented lots of ways to trigger multiple timers consecutively and it occurred delays and skips. But finally figured out how to make the most precise timer!!

##Things to fix

 * There is a small bug in chart. Sometimes it mislabels the X Axis. 
 * Didn't implement the beep sound yet. 
 * Not enough time...
