#### 3. Date
3/17/16

#### 4. Background
I came up with this idea based on my personal experience. I've been doing the high intensity interval workout(HIIT) daily, and it needs a specific timer. The HIIT timer apps in PlayStore now were not enough to satisfy my needs. I wanted them to have more features but be simple at the same time. 

#### 5. Goals
* I want to know if users want the timer to be highly customizable. 
* I want to know what they want most from workout app or what motivates them. 
* What do users want from a timer app?  

#### 6. Research questions
* Do the users want to have a highly customizable app? 
* What feature do the users value most? 
* Do they want something that will make them get back to workout?
* What do users want from a timer app? 

#### 7. Methodology 
The research will be done outside by 1:1 interview session. It will be around 5-10 minutes. 

#### 8. Participants 
* People who do workout regularly. 
* People who are interestsed in workout. 
* People in the gym. 
* 20-30's 

#### 9. Schedule 
* Everything will be done on a same day. 3/17/16. 

#### 10. Script
